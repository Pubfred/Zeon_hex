ZEON Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

ZEON is a brand new digital currency building up a global Community to be united against scam-attempts. We will offer Swap-Solutions for Communitys which has been scammed. Also we will Support Charity Organisations and - who knows - eventually you all onedays can pay in big Online Shops with our United Coin (UC). The Community stands at first place, so there will be a Government System where each holder can vote for actual Projects. It is NOT intented to be a HIGH ROI Coin, we will offer support for scammed Peoples as a long-Term Subject.
You may ask why we have such a huge Premine?! To offer swaps for scammed coins we need a lot of Coins and also there will be a fee during the Lifetime of the Project so that we can offer the swaps (with a specific ratio).

The ZEON Code was forked from [XDNA Project](https://xdna.io/).

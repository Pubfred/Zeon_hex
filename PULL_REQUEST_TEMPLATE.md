## Readme advice

Please review this section if you are updating readme documentation.

**Readme template**

This project uses [verb][] for documentation. Verb generates the project's readme documentation from the [.verb.md](../.verb.md) template in the root of this project.

Make all documentation changes in `.verb.md`, and please _do not edit the readme.md directly_, or your changes might accidentally get overwritten.

**Code comments**

Please add code comments (following the same style as existing comments) to describe any code changes or new code introduced by your pull request.

**Optionally build the readme**

Any changes made `.verb.md` and/or code comments will be automatically incorporated into the README documentation the next time `verb` is run.

We can take care of building the documentation for you when we merge in your changes, or feel free to run [verb][] yourself. Whatever you prefer is fine with us.

## package.json contributors

**Add yourself!**

When adding your information to the `contributors` array in package.json, please use the following format (provide your name at minimum, the other fields are optional):

```
full name <email@address.com> (https://website.com)
```

**Example**

```json
// -- package.json --
{
  "name": "<%= name %>",
  "contributors": [
    "Brian Woodward <jon.schlinkert@sellside.com> (https://github.com/jonschlinkert)",
    "Jon Schlinkert <brian.woodward@sellside.com> (https://github.com/doowb)",
  ]
}
```

_(If a `contributors` array does not already exist, please feel free to add one wherever you want, and congratulations on being the first to contribute!)_
